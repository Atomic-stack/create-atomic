An opinionated TypeScript build toolchain for modern, standard JS libraries.

## Zero config out-of-the-box
Batteries included:
  - editorconfig
  - Pretier
  - Eslint standard
  - tsconfigs for browser/node.

Stop js fatigue and focus on building and shipping!

Minimalistic but also flexible.

## Modern standards
Write the latest and greatest TypeScript.

Ship JavaScript modules that are standards-compliant and performance oriented.
