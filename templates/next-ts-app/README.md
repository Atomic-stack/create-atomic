This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-atomic`](https://github.com/Atomic-stack/create-atomic).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello.ts`.

The `app/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Using a Database

Set the database provider in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.

The `DATABASE_URL` specified in a .env file is used to connect to the database.

Whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema in the future, you need to run `npx prisma generate` in order to generate the updated Prisma Client types.

After updating the models, the new schema can be deployed running `npx prisma db-push`.

To learn more about migrations see the [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) docs.
