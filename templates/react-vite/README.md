## Get Started
`npm install` install the dependencies.

`npm start` start the app.

### Project structure
```
src
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ routes
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â””â”€â”€ root.tsx
```

ðŸ‘‰ The app entry point is the `index.html` which imports the `root.tsx` module.

The pages of the app live inside the `routes` directory and they are mounted in the routes defined in the `App.tsx` component.

Also these commands should be helpful!

`npm run lint` and fix any errors (or `npm run lint:fix`.)

`npm run format` to format the code.

`npm test` to run tests.
