# <%= projectName %>

This project is a modern Preact and TypeScript app, compatible with React components and libraries out of the box.

ðŸ‘‰ [Preact docs](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started)

## Get Started
`npm install` install the dependencies.

`npm start` start the app.

### Project structure
```
src
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ app.tsx
â””â”€â”€ main.tsx
```

ðŸ‘‰ The app entry point is the `index.html` which imports the `main.tsx` module.

Also these commands should be helpful!

`npm run lint` and fix any errors (or `npm run lint:fix`.)

`npm run format` to format the code.

`npm test` to run tests.
